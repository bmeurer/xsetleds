This is the README file for xsetleds version 0.1.x.

To compile, you just need the standard make+gcc+glibc suite and in
addition the X11 development files, including the header files and
the libraries. These files are most packaged into something called
xlibs-dev or similar. If your operating system vendor forget to include
X11, you can use the open source implementation XFree86. You can get
it from:

	http://www.xfree86.org/

This package was mainly tested for glibc >= 2.1 on Debian GNU/Linux,
but it should also compile well with libc5.

In addition, xsetleds use the Xkb extension to X11, so be sure, this
is available on your system.

To compile and install this package:

1) unpack the downloaded tarball

2) run "./configure --help" to look for configuration parameters

3) run "./configure" with the chosen options

3) invoke "make" and "make install".
